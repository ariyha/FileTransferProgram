# Secure Data Transmission System

## Project Overview

This project is a secure data transmission system developed using Python. It includes a server-client architecture, where the server handles data processing, and the client interacts with the user through a web interface. The communication between the client and server is encrypted using the PyCrypto library.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python used for the client-side web interface.
- **PyCrypto**: A Python library for cryptographic functions.

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask pycryptodome
'''

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Running the Server
Configure IP Address: Open the server.py file and enter the appropriate IP address in the relevant function.

Start the Server: Run the server by executing the following command:

'''bash
python server.py
'''
### 2. Running the Client
Configure Server IP: Open the client_idea.py file and enter the server's IP address.

Start Flask Application: Run the Flask application by executing:

'''bash
python flasktp.py
'''
Access Web Interface: After starting Flask, you will see a prompted web address in the console. Open this URL in your web browser to interact with the application.

## Directory Setup
File Paths: Ensure that the appropriate file paths are correctly set in the server files.
Client-Side Directory: Create a folder named client_side in the C: drive to store metadata.
'''bash
mkdir C:\client_side
'''
